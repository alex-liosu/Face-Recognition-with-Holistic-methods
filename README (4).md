# Statistical Modeling Midterm Project

## üìñ Introduction
This repository contains the **midterm project for STAT 7730**, focusing on statistical modeling and data analysis.  
The project applies **regression models** to analyze real-world data, diagnose issues, and evaluate predictive performance.  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, handling missing values, and exploratory data analysis.  
- **Model Construction**:  
  - Linear regression models.  
  - Transformation of variables to improve linearity and normality.  
  - Variable selection methods (AIC/BIC).  
- **Diagnostics**: Residual analysis, heteroscedasticity checks, multicollinearity evaluation.  
- **Model Extensions**: Ridge regression and regularization methods considered for stability.  

## üìä Results & Insights
- Identified key predictors with significant impact on the response variable.  
- Model diagnostics showed violations of assumptions in initial models, which were corrected through transformation and variable selection.  
- Regularization approaches helped address multicollinearity.  

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
- Final regression model provided interpretable and stable estimates.  
- Demonstrated understanding of regression diagnostics, transformations, and remedial measures.  
- Showcased application of both classical and modern regression approaches.
